# Rolling horizon product quality estimation and online optimization for supply chain management of perishable inventory

## Abstract 
We introduce new methods inspired from dynamical systems and control theory for estimating the quality of perishable products in inventory in a supply chain based on measurable data. A state-space representation of the supply chain with perishable inventory is constructed, and controllability and observability properties are established. Rolling horizon state estimation is formulated to estimate the quality of inventory at locations where measurements are not available. This is combined with an online optimization framework inspired by model predictive control to define an implicit supply chain management policy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach, as well as its benefits for supply chain optimization (approximately 40% improvement in the cost objective relative to the baseline model).
